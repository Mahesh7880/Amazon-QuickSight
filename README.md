# 🚀 📊 Visualising Netflix's Catalogue Trends with Amazon Overview QuickSight

## **Project Overview**  
A hands-on data analytics project where I used Amazon S3 and Amazon QuickSight to build an interactive dashboard showcasing trends in Netflix’s global content catalogue

### Project Highlights
🔍 Throughout this AWS project, I learned how to:

✅ Upload and securely store datasets in **Amazon S3**.  
✅ Connect these datasets seamlessly to **Amazon QuickSight** for interactive analysis.  
✅ Design and build visualisations, including **donut charts, bar graphs, and tables**.  
✅ Address complex data questions with QuickSight’s tools, creating insights from raw data.

✅ The grand finale was building a cohesive dashboard to unite all visualisations a rewarding process that brought every element together!
